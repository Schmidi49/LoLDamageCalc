# LoLDamageCalc
LoLDamageCalc aims to give a simple tool (first iteration would be a commandline interface with inputs like "eaqa". This would calculate the damage of an e auto q auto combo) to calculate damage of certain cahmpions with itembuild to compare damage. Note that thsi is not aimed to be an ingame overly in any way, it is just an out of the game theory crafting tool.
